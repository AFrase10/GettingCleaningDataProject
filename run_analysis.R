
#Review criteria 
#--The submitted data set is tidy.
#--The Github repo contains the required scripts.
#--GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables 
#and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
#--The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
#--The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 
#The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
#The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a
# series of yes/no questions related to the project. 
# You will be required to submit: 
#1) a tidy data set as described below, 
#2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
#3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to
#clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 
#This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

#One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article .
#Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.
#The data linked to from the course website rep resent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
#A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

######  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Here are the data for the project:

######  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

#--Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#--Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#--Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#--Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#--From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
#for each activity and each subject.
